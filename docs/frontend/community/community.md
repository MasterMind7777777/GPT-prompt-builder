### Community Collaboration Module

#### Responsibilities

1. **Managing Community Interactions**
    - **How it looks**:  
        - Below each template card on the main dashboard, large tactile buttons are separated by vertical dividers. These feature universally recognized icons: a paper airplane for 'Share', a chat bubble for 'Comment', and a thumbs-up for 'Upvote'. Each button is color-coded: green for sharing, blue for commenting, and orange for upvoting.
    - **How to interact**:  
        - **Sharing**: Clicking on the green "Share" button opens a pop-up with social media icons.  
        - **Commenting**: The blue "Comment" button leads to a comment section at the bottom of the page.  
        - **Upvoting**: A single click on the orange "Upvote" button fills in the thumbs-up icon, showing your vote.

2. **Notification System**
    - **How it looks**:  
        - A notification bell icon is at the top right of the screen. New notifications trigger a small red circle with a number on the bell.
    - **How to interact**:  
        - Clicking on the bell drops down a list of notifications, each a clickable card describing the interaction and who it's from.

#### Key Features

1. **Tag-Based Template Search**
    - **How it looks**:  
        - A search bar with a tag-shaped button is above the template dashboard.
    - **How to interact**:  
        - The tag-shaped button displays a dropdown with pre-set tags. Users can select one or multiple tags to filter templates.

2. **Nested Comments**
    - **How it looks**:  
        - Comments are neatly organized with a "Reply" button and an expandable list of nested comments underneath each main comment.
    - **How to interact**:  
        - The "Reply" button opens a smaller text box for replies just below the comment being replied to.

3. **Real-Time Notifications**
    - **How it looks**:  
        - A pop-up bubble at the bottom right corner appears for new interactions.
    - **How to interact**:  
        - The pop-up is clickable and directs to the specific template or comment related to the notification.
