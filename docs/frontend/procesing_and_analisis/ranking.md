## Ranking System Module

### Responsibilities

#### User Rankings on Templates

- **How it looks**: 
  - Below each template preview card, you'll find a set of five empty stars, each representing a rating from 1 to 5.
  - Beside the stars, text placeholders like 'Relevancy', 'Accuracy', and 'Ease of Use' are neatly displayed. 
  - A small 'Submit' button will be situated right below these rating stars.

- **How to interact**: 
  - Hover your mouse over the stars and they fill in, giving you a visual cue for your potential rating. 
  - Click on the star that best represents your experience. For example, clicking on the third star would rate the template as a 3 out of 5.
  - Clicking 'Submit' finalizes your ranking, and a small pop-up message confirms your action.

#### Interactive Display of Rankings

- **How it looks**:
  - A panel on the right side of your screen, styled in softer colors to ensure it doesn't dominate the templates, shows rankings in real-time.
  - This panel has its title—'Top Ranked Templates'—in a slightly larger and bold font, making it easily distinguishable.

- **How to interact**:
  - The templates in the panel can be clicked on for a quick view. Hovering over a template will also show a tooltip with a brief description.

### Key Features

#### Ranking Algorithm Selection

- **How it looks**: 
  - An elegant dropdown menu situated at the top-right of the ranking panel with a label like "Sort By."
  - The options will display algorithm names like 'Most Popular', 'Top Rated', 'Most Recent', etc. Next to each name, a little icon represents the type of ranking. 

- **How to interact**: 
  - Click on the dropdown, scroll through the list of ranking methods, and click the one you want to apply.
  - The ranking list updates in real-time, reorganizing the templates based on your chosen algorithm.

#### Graphical Representation

- **How it looks**: 
  - Below the ranking list, there are clickable icons or tabs for different chart types: Bar, Pie, and Line Graph.
  - Charts and graphs are rendered in soft color schemes to make them easy on the eyes but still visually distinct.

- **How to interact**: 
  - Hovering over a specific point or bar in a chart will display a tooltip that gives more detail—such as how many people gave a similar rating.
  - Clicking on a bar or point in a chart brings up a more detailed view, potentially in a modal window, which will provide further insights into the rating distribution for that particular template.
