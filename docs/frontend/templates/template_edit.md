### Visual Components:

#### Split-Screen UI:

1. **Editor Panel**: On the left side of the screen, users will find a clean, white space editor where they can type and edit their template content.
  
2. **Preview Panel**: To the right of the editor, a real-time preview shows how the template will look when generated. It updates in real-time as users modify the template.

3. **Template Parts & Tags Sidebar**: A collapsible sidebar on the left will show a list of template parts like "Title," "Body," and "Footer," as well as a list of tags that are attached to the template.

4. **Toolbar**: At the top, a toolbar will offer options for setting template visibility, duplicating templates, and saving changes.

#### Template Variations:

1. **Styles Dropdown**: Near the top of the Editor Panel, users can find a dropdown to select predefined styles or structures for their templates. Selecting one will populate the editor with a sample template.

2. **Theme Toggle**: For better visual comfort, users can toggle between dark and light themes.

### Interaction Options:

1. **Click to Edit**: In the Template Parts & Tags Sidebar, clicking on a part will scroll the editor to that section and highlight it for easy modifications.

2. **Drag and Drop**: Users can rearrange the order of the template parts by dragging and dropping them within the sidebar.

3. **Tagging**: To add a tag, users can type it into a "Add Tag" field below the list of template parts. Existing tags will auto-suggest as users type.

4. **Visibility Toggle**: A small eye icon in the toolbar will allow users to toggle between visibility settings ("Public," "Private," "Shared").

5. **Save & Version History**: A floppy disk icon will save the current template. Next to it, a clock icon will reveal a dropdown list of previously saved versions of the template, allowing users to revert changes.

6. **Real-time Metrics**: At the bottom of the Preview Panel, small statistic icons will show real-time performance metrics of the template, like average rating or usage count.

7. **Comment Section**: A speech bubble icon in the toolbar opens a panel below the editor where users can read and post comments about the template.

8. **Share Button**: A share icon in the toolbar opens a modal where users can type in usernames to share the template with them directly.

9. **Ranking Stars**: Next to the template name at the top, a set of empty stars appear. Users can click to rate the template, and the average rating will be displayed.
