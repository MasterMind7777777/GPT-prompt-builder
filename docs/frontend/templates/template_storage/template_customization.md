## User Customization

### Floating Settings Cog

- **Visuals**:
  - A semi-transparent, modestly sized cog icon that adheres to the overall design language of the application, ensuring consistency.

- **Location**:
  - Fixed at the bottom-right corner of the screen, ensuring accessibility as users navigate different parts of the application.

- **Interactions**:
  - On hover, the cog icon slightly enlarges, and a subtle shadow appears, indicating it is interactive.
  - Clicking the cog darkens the rest of the page and reveals the settings menu, directing user focus towards customization options.

#### React

- **Component Structure**:
  - Create a separate React component named `SettingsCog`. This helps in managing its state and behavior independently, facilitating code reusability and maintenance.
  
- **Event Handling**:
  - Implement an `onClick` event handler to manage the visibility of the settings menu. When the cog icon is clicked, it should update a state variable that controls the display of the settings menu.
  
- **State Management**:
  - Utilize a state variable, possibly named `isSettingsMenuVisible`, to manage the visibility of the settings menu. Initialize it as `false`, and toggle its value based on user interactions with the cog icon and other elements within the settings menu.

- **Integration**:
  - Incorporate the `SettingsCog` component within the main layout of the application, ensuring it is accessible from every part of the application where customization is allowed.

#### CSS

- **Visuals**:
  - Utilize CSS properties such as `opacity` to create a semi-transparent appearance, adjusting the level as per the design requirement.
  - Use CSS transitions to smoothly enlarge the cog icon and introduce a subtle shadow on hover. Utilize the `transform: scale();` and `box-shadow` properties for these effects.

- **Positioning**:
  - Leverage CSS `position: fixed;` to keep the cog icon in the bottom-right corner of the viewport at all times.
  - Use `bottom` and `right` properties to fine-tune the exact positioning of the icon, ensuring it doesn’t obstruct any essential content or functionality.

- **Responsiveness**:
  - Employ media queries to adjust the size and position of the cog icon based on the viewport size, ensuring it maintains an optimal appearance and functionality across various devices.

### Settings Menu

- **Visuals**:
  - Presented as a central, semi-translucent modal that overlays the main content, which gets darkened to bring user focus to the customization options.
  - The menu is organized with clear sections such as ‘Theme’, ‘Font Size’, ‘Layout’, and action buttons like ‘Save/Cancel’, each paired with intuitive icons and labels for clarity.

- **Location**:
  - The menu emerges at the center of the page, overtaking user focus from the existing content but maintaining a connection with the overall page layout.

- **Interactions**:
  - **Theme Toggle**: Allows switching between available themes, like a light or dark mode, with immediate visual feedback upon selection.
  - **Font Size Slider**: Users can adjust the text size, witnessing changes in real-time to find their preferred readability level.
  - **Layout Selection**: Users can choose between different layout presentations, enhancing personal comfort and usability.
  - **Save/Cancel Buttons**: 
     - ‘Save’ instantly applies user customizations, supported by a success notification or subtle visual cue.
     - ‘Cancel’ disregards any unsaved changes, with a confirmation step to prevent accidental loss of adjustments, ensuring a smooth, error-minimized user experience.


#### React

- **Component Structure**:
  - Create a new functional component called `SettingsMenu` that will encapsulate all the logic and rendering of the settings menu.

- **State Management**:
  - Maintain local state variables for each interactive element within the menu, such as `theme`, `fontSize`, and `layout`.
  - Use these state variables to facilitate real-time updates as the user interacts with the various customization options.

- **Event Handling**:
  - `Theme Toggle`: Implement event handlers to capture the user's theme selection and update the respective state variable.
  - `Font Size Slider`: Create an event handler that updates the `fontSize` state as the user interacts with the slider.
  - `Layout Selection`: Similar to the theme toggle, handle user interactions and state updates seamlessly.
  - `Save/Cancel Buttons`: 
    - For the ‘Save’ button, implement an event handler to apply the changes globally, possibly using a global state manager like Redux or Context API.
    - For the ‘Cancel’ button, implement functionality to revert the local state variables to their initial values, disregarding unsaved changes.

#### CSS

- **Visuals**:
  - Utilize CSS styles to achieve a semi-translucent appearance for the modal. Play around with the `background-color` opacity.
  - Style each section within the menu, like ‘Theme’, ‘Font Size’, and ‘Layout’, ensuring visual distinction and hierarchy.

- **Positioning**:
  - Use CSS positioning attributes like `position: fixed;`, `top: 50%;`, and `left: 50%;` combined with transform to center the modal in the viewport.
  
- **Animation**:
  - Employ CSS transitions or animations to smoothly display the settings menu when it's toggled. Utilize the `opacity` and `transform` properties for a fading and sliding effect.
  
- **Responsiveness**:
  - Incorporate media queries to ensure that the settings menu adapts gracefully to various screen sizes, maintaining usability and visual appeal.
  
- **Interactions**:
  - Style interactive elements like toggles and sliders with hover and active states, using pseudo-classes like `:hover` and `:active` to provide user feedback.
