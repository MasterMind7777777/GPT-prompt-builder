## Direct Template Linking

### Visual Representation and Location

- **Share Button**:
  - Appears as a small, semi-transparent icon (possibly a chain/link symbol) on the upper corner of each template card.
  - Reveals itself when a user hovers over a specific template card, ensuring the UI remains clean and only displays additional options when necessary.

- **Popup Window**:
  - Activated upon clicking the 'Share' button, opening close to the button to maintain a connection between the action and the result.
  - Stylish, with a simple design, incorporating a well-defined boundary to distinguish it from the background content. 

### Interactions

- **Hover Over Template Card**:
  - Moving the cursor over a template card reveals the 'Share' button, inviting the user to initiate the sharing process.

- **Clicking the Share Button**:
  - Activates a popup that provides a unique direct link to the template.
  - The popup remains open, awaiting further user interaction, such as copying the link or closing the popup.

- **Popup Window**:
  - Displays a readonly text field containing the unique URL, ensuring users can’t accidentally modify the link.
  - Features a 'Copy Link' button, enabling users to easily copy the URL to their clipboard for sharing purposes.

- **Copying the Link**:
  - Clicking the 'Copy Link' button automatically copies the URL to the user’s clipboard, ready to be shared.
  - Provides visual feedback, such as a brief text message like "Link Copied!", confirming the action's success and guiding the user’s next steps.

- **Closing the Popup**:
  - Users can close the popup either by clicking outside of it or by pressing a dedicated close button within the popup, allowing for a flexible and intuitive user experience.

### UX Flow

- **Efficiency and Simplicity**:
  - Design the process to be straightforward and intuitive, minimizing the number of steps and actions required from the user.
  - Aim for clear visual cues and easy-to-understand interactions, ensuring users, regardless of their tech-savviness, can successfully share templates.

#### React

- **Component Structure**:
  - A `ShareButton` component that is conditionally rendered within each `TemplateCard` component.
  - A `SharePopup` component that is triggered by the `ShareButton` click event. This component should manage and display the sharing URL.

- **Event Handling**:
  - `onMouseOver` and `onMouseOut` events on `TemplateCard` to handle the visibility of the `ShareButton`.
  - `onClick` event on the `ShareButton` to open the `SharePopup`.
  - `onClick` event on the `Copy Link` button inside the `SharePopup` to copy the template’s unique URL to the clipboard.

#### CSS

- **Styling Tools**:
  - CSS Preprocessors such as SASS or LESS for variable and mixin functionalities.
  - CSS-in-JS solutions such as styled-components for scoping the CSS locally to components and dynamic styling.

- **Layout**:
  - Flexbox for positioning the `ShareButton` within the `TemplateCard` and for aligning items within the `SharePopup`.
  - CSS Grid might be used if a more complex layout is necessary within the `SharePopup`.

- **Animations and Transitions**:
  - CSS Transitions for smooth appearance and disappearance of the `ShareButton` and `SharePopup`.
  - Consider third-party libraries like `react-spring` for more complex animations if necessary.

- **Typography**:
  - Google Fonts or system fonts for clean and readable text within the `SharePopup`.
  - Font Awesome or Material Icons for recognizable icons such as the share symbol.

- **Responsive Design**:
  - Media Queries to adjust styles based on the viewport width, ensuring a good presentation on mobile and desktop devices.
  - Em or Rem units for font sizes and spacing, ensuring scalability and accessibility.

- **Colors and Themes**:
  - CSS Variables or SASS/LESS variables for managing and applying consistent colors and themes across the `ShareButton` and `SharePopup`.

- **Interaction States**:
  - Pseudo-classes such as `:hover` and `:active` for interactive elements like the `ShareButton` and items within the `SharePopup`, providing visual feedback.
  - A focus state for interactive elements ensuring accessibility.

- **Positioning**:
  - Absolute positioning for the `ShareButton` within the `TemplateCard` and fixed or absolute positioning for the `SharePopup` relative to the viewport or `ShareButton`.

- **Borders and Shadows**:
  - CSS box-shadow property for subtle shadows to highlight the `SharePopup`.
  - Border-radius for rounded corners on the `ShareButton` and `SharePopup`, softening their appearance.
